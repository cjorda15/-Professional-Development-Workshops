Think about the last time you received feedback

What emotions did you experience when hearing the feedback?
How useful was the feedback you received?


My emotions are sometimes hard to separate from taking the advice in for what
it was and for how I felt about my work. I would feel that the person
offering the feedback had less credit afterwards because it was like, come
on, who is this guy/girl??? This isn't usually the case, I truly, do want
to take in what the other person is offering, but sometimes you can't help, but
be curious why he/she is telling me this and other reasons for why I wouldn't
take the message for what it is.
